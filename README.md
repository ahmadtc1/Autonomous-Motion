# Autonomous-Motion
An autonomous robot developed with the use of three ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensors
The attached Arduino file works for an autonomous robot using three HC-SR04 sensors. One at the front, and two on each side. This code
uses each of the three sensors in order to guide the robot so that it does not collide with obstacles, but rather avoids obstacles and
travels along a safe path instead
