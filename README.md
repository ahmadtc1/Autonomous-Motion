### Sensors
The Arduino microcontroller is connected to 3 HC-SR04 sensors. One at the front, and one on either side. These three sensors provide the robot with information about its surroundings, based off which it's able to navigate environments autonomously

### Arduino
The robot as programmed using Arduino, essentially using C++/C as the Arduino language is essentially a set of C++/C functions.
